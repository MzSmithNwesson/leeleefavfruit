        Hi! My name is LeeLee. I am the owner of the Starwberry Sanctuary. I
        absolutely love strawberries! Their vibrant red color and sweet, juicy
        flavor make them one of my favorite fruits. Whether eaten as a snack or
        used in desserts and other recipes, strawberries always add a delicious
        burst of flavor. In fact, I can't get enough of them! Whether fresh or
        frozen, in smoothies or on top of cereal, strawberries are simply
        irresistible.
        <br>
        Strawberries and raspberries aren't really berries in the botanical sense. 
        They are derived from a single flower with <em>more than one ovary</em>, 
        making them an <strong>aggregate fruit.</strong> True berries are simple fruits stemming from 
        one flower with <em>one ovary</em> and typically have several seeds.

      The strawberry was first described in literature as early as 1000AD and
      the first sketch of a strawberry plant was printed in 1484. The first
      mention of strawberries occurred sometime between 234-149 BC in the
      writings of Cato, a Roman Senator. <br>Cultivated strawberry emerged from the
      hybridization of two wild octoploid species, both descendants from the
      merger of four diploid progenitor species into a single nucleus more than
      1 million years ago. <br> The garden strawberry is a widely grown hybrid
      species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries,
      which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely
      appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture,
      and sweetness.

      Strawberries are packed with antioxidants and essential nutrients that can
      reduce inflammation, support heart health, boost cognitive function, aid
      digestion and help regulate blood sugar. While strawberries are generally
      safe for most individuals, it's essential to be mindful of potential
      allergies or sensitivities.
      <br />
      Studies have shown that consuming two and a half servings of strawberries
      each day (approximately 32 grams) lowers blood insulin levels and
      resistance. It was proven that eating this nutritious fruit daily helps
      decrease cholesterol levels. The anthocyanins found in this fruit improve
      short-term memory.
